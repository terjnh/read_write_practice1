Read Write Practice App using Qt and C++ integration

"-----"

### TODO:
- [X] Try to pass data between QML and C++
- [X] Now we can automate read-write with a button with a fixed file

- [ ] Remove QML Second Page - 'Open File' Button (clean up code with the removal)
- [ ] A UI-element to allow write to a file with a custom message
- [ ] A UI-element to allow read from a file

- [ ] Parse JSON with QML - very similar to Javascript (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41900383/parsing-json-in-qml/41900561)
- [ ] Read text file (eg .json/.txt) (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8894531/reading-a-line-from-a-txt-or-csv-file-in-qml-qt-quick/8915904#8915904)
