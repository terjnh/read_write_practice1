"-----"

### TODO:
- [X] Try to pass data between QML and C++
- [X] Now we can automate read-write with a button with a fixed file
<br/>
- [ ] Remove QML Second Page - 'Open File' Button (clean up code with the removal)
- [X] A UI-element to allow write to a file with a custom message (done on IO Page)
- [ ] A UI-element to allow read from a file
<br/>
- [ ] Save to a file (JSON format)
- [ ] Read JSON data from a file
- [ ] Organize read JSON data to a more presentable UI format
